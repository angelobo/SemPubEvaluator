Selected constructs are mapped to one or more Construct Agent B-threads (CABs). Run together, those CABs generate a valid execution of the original program."

After the user clicks two cards, a beep is issued, and the two cards are compared. If the cards are different, they are flipped back down. The click method shows the cardsâ€™ faces, and the flipDown method turns them over again. The first two events may or may not happen, are thus cold (blue). The ensuing three events must happen once the first two events have, and are thus hot (red). The Sync construct forces the Beep to occur after the second click."
