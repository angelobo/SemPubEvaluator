<http://ceur-ws.org/figure/vol-1315-paper3_fig1>, "1"^^xsd:integer, "A simplified view of the GLAM-PS architecture showing the four modules used in the Algebra Model and communication between these modules. PM is the Production Memory."
<http://ceur-ws.org/figure/vol-1315-paper3_fig2>, "2"^^xsd:integer, "Visualization of state of the GLAM-PS Algebra Model (GAM) when the control state has been established that begins transition from the Reading sub-goal to Solving the Addend sub-goal when solving 3x + 5 = 11. Working memory elements (WMEs) are depicted as squares with area proportional to their activation. The WMEs contributing to the control state are circled in red, with their locus of action indicated by arrows pointing to the Visual Input production memory. GAM’s current eye fixation is depicted on the left. Cycle indicates the number of production cycles from the beginning of simulation run."
<http://ceur-ws.org/figure/vol-1315-paper3_fig3>, "3"^^xsd:integer, "Visualisation of the state of GAM when the control state has been established that begins the sub-goal of resolving the multiplier (the ‘3’ in ‘3x’). See caption to Fig 2. for key."
<http://ceur-ws.org/figure/vol-1315-paper3_fig4>, "4"^^xsd:integer, "A graphical display of the number of decision cycles needed to complete the equation 3x + 5 = 11 by the GLAM-PS Algebra Model when working memory capacity (δ) and the activation needed to match productions (y) were systematically varied. Light blue indicates the model did not solve the equation. The data is displayed in partial 3D and lit from the x-axis."
