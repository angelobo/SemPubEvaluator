A schematic overview of the data formalization layers serving distributed data integration in the DebugIT interoperability platform. Clinical data in local relational databases (I) can be accessed in real-time via SPARQL querying the local endpoints via a DSSQ using DDOs on an Extract Transform Load wrapper (II). Integrated cross-site queries can be stated as CASQ using DCO and Operational Ontologies (OO) (III). The DDO (local) to DCO (global) binding is done via N3 mapping rules enforced by the Euler Eye reasoner. CASQ results are fed back to the clinical researcher or into applications e.g. a resistance monitor. For each data representation layer I - III a layer-specific mapping process had to be employed which binds each representational layer to the succeeding layer above. I.e., the first mapping α (D2R mappings) binds the underlying relational database layer (I) to the RDF representation layer (layer II), the next mapping β (N3 and SKOS) binds the RDF layer II to the Domain Ontology (DO) layer III. These stacked mappings enable each semantic layer to 'interpret' the results provided by the layer one level below with a fixed semantics and hence allow a user or a monitoring tool to query distributed clinical data integratively."

Population monitoring is here build around a parametrisable dashboard, where individual visualization portlets, called gadg-ets, show the results of the CASQ SPARQL queries for the selected hospital sites at Linköping University Hospital (LIU), University Hospital of Geneva (HUG), University Clinic Freiburg (Averbis) and on selected additional variables. New gadgets can be dragged in, according to each user’s needs and preferences."
