<h1>SemPub Challenge @ ESWC - Evaluation</h1>
<p>This page describes the evaluation process to identify the best-performing approach of the Semantic Publishing Challenge at ESWC.</p>

<p>The result of a set of queries on the submitted LOD is compared with a gold standard, and precision and recall are measured. Both the gold standard and the output under evaluation are expected to be CSV files with a common structure. The evaluation is performed by a PHP software, available on <a href="https://github.com/angelobo/SemPubEvaluator">GitHub</a>, that compares each pair of corresponding CSV files.</p> 
<p>Two evaluation modes are supported:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>strict</i>: only complete matches are considered correct, after some normalization</li>
	<li><i>loose</i>: more tolerant, some partial matches are considered correct too</li>	
</ul>
<p>For some queries these two modes overlap (same evaluation strategies).</p>

<p>General notes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>For each type of entry (es. article, funding agency, grant, ontology, etc.) specific comparison strategies are implemented (in the <code>matchesEntry()</code> method of the corresponding class).</li>
	<li>The IRIs structure is ignored, as participants were free to use their own model and structure.</li>
	<li>The order of the CSV entries is not relevant.</li>
	<li>Unexpected duplicates are considered errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the evaluation mechanisms are implemented so as to take minor differences into account and to normalize them:</p>
<ul>
	<li>All values are trimmed and transformed into lowercase.</li>
	<li>Missing &quot; symbols around CSV values are ignored.</li>
	<li>Titles are normalized as follows: all spaces, punctuation symbols and non-ASCII characters are stripped, only letters and numbers are considered. </li>
	<li>Names are normalized as follows: all spaces, punctuation symbols are stripped, non-ASCII characters are substituted with ASCII characters. </li>	
	<li>Missing datatypes are ignored.</li>
</ul>
